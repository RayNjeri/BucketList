# Bucketlist API
## Introduction

According to Merriam-Webster Dictionary, a Bucket List is a list of things that one has not done before but wants to do before dying.
This is an API for an online Bucket List service using Flask.

## Requirements

The building blocks used are:
  1. python version 3.6
  2. Flask
  3. PostgresSQL

## Installation

 The following set of steps are necessary to facilitate running the application locally:

   - clone the following repo
        `https://github.com/RayNjeri/BucketList/tree/develop`
        
   - cd into `Bucketlist` and create a VirtualEnvironment using the following command:
        `virtualenv <name_of_env>`
   - To activate the virtualenv, cd into the `<name_of_env>/bin/` and use the following command:
        `source activate`
   - To install all app requirements
        `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Create the database and run migrations
   
        `$ python manage.py db init`

        `$ python manage.py db migrate`

        `$ python manage.py db upgrade`

 __You are now set!__
